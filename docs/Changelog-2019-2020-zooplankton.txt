# Changelog for 2019 and 2020  IYS Bongo Data

The original data files used for the standardization of the 2019 and 2020 IYS zooplankton bongo data are:

Metadata: 

- Bongo2020_metadata.xlsx
- IYS cruise logbook_2019.xlsx

Data:

- IYSZoopAbund2019_2020Long.csv
- IYSKaganoSpecRemovedfromNet.csv

The file used for the previous, unreleased version of this data (IYS zooplankton taxonomy data 20210115.xlsx) is archived in /original_data/archived. The new data source files (note - data source files, not metadata source files) were received from Joanne Breckenridge (UBC) who has connected with the data provider of the previous version of this dataset to ensure the changes captured in the new source files are accurate. 

This changelog highlights any changes made to the data package between this version and the previous, unreleased version. Any changes made on the data source files to aid with standardization to OBIS have been captured in the .Rmd script 'data_wrangle_bongo.Rmd' and are not recorded here. 

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. Any scripts used to aid in data tidying can be found in `data_wrangle_bongo.Rmd`.
